Bender to Zoidberg: "You're looking less nuts, crabby." 
%
Leela: "It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast."

 swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material." 
Fry: "You and me both, brother."

Fry: "Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. Yes?" 
Zoidberg: "Is the desire to mate a feeling?"

Edna: "Excuse me, I've got to powder my mouth flaps."

Morbo: "Morbo agrees." 
%
Human female: "All in all. This is one day that mitten the kitten will not 
 soon forget."

Human female: "And so with two weeks left in the campaign, the question 
 on everyone's mind is, who will be the president of Earth? 
 Jack Johnson or bitter rival John Jackson.

Human female: "In other local news, disaster struck on Saturn's moon of Titan 
 today, where titanium mine collapsed, trapping one thousand 
 robot workers. Unless something is done quickly the trapped 
 robots will be dead within 300 years. Sir, what rescue 
 operations are planned?" 
Mine spokesman: "The plan is basically to pave over the area and get on with 
 our lives." 
Morbo: "The news of mine's closing sent titanium prices sky 
 rocketing."

Morbo: "Morbo will now introduce tonights candidates. Puny human 
 number one, puny human number two and Morbo's good friend

Nixon: "Good man, Nixon's pro-war and pro-family." 
%
Morbo: "Morbo demands an answer to the following question. If you saw 
 a delicious candy in the hands of a small child. Would you 
 seize and consume it?" 
John Jackson: "Unthinkable."
Jack Johnson: "I wouldn't think of it." 
Morbo: "What about you Mr. Nixon? I remind you. You are under of a 
 truth-o-scope."
Nixon: "Question is vague. You don't say what kind of candy and 
 whether anyone is watching. In anyway I certainly wouldn't
 harm the child."
%
Human female: "The sheer drama of this election has driven voter turnout to 
 it's highest level in centuries, six percent." 
Morbo: "Exit poll show evil underdog Richard Nixon trailing with 
 estimated zero votes." 
Human female: "The time is 7:59 and the robot polls are now opening. And 
 robot votes are now in. Nixon has won." 
Morbo: "Morbo congratulates our gargantuan cyborg president. May death 
 come quickly to his enemies." 
%
Human female: "The holiday season is time of celebration for most but it is 
 also the time to remember the tragic suffering of the less 
 fortunate." 
Morbo: "Earthlings do not yet know the meaning of suffering." 
Human female: "Earlier today I visited the shelter for down-and-out robots. 
 Homeless robots too poor to afford even the basic alcohol they 
 need fuel their circuits. Is there anything sadder? 
 Only drowning puppies and there have to be a lot of them."
